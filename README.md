# 👋 Hi there, I’m Michael

Hi, I'm Michael — a Platform Engineer with roots in old-school Unix, a love for automation, and a deep respect for documentation, empathy, and sustainable infrastructure.

I've spent my career building and running reliable systems. These days, I'm focused on evolving with the modern DevOps and platform engineering ecosystem—Terraform, cloud-native stacks, GitOps, and open source collaboration.

I'm building forward — in public this time.
